# Libejovo Documentation

**Libejovo is a collection of numerical routines used in scientific computing.**

Starting out as a small set of utility functions that I wrote for my homework at Polytech Sorbonne, this library has evolved into a comprehensive summary of the Applied Mathematics that I've learned throughout the pursuit of my engineering degree. Written in C, Libejovo contains essential routines that facilitate efficient and easy-to-work-with number crunching programs.

The goal of this project is to become a much stronger scientific programmer and to implement a simple API for numerical programming in C.
